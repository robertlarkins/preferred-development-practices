### Pull Request config

### Red Exclamation Mark

The red exclamation mark on the Remote button is there because the Remote account isn't set in the repo settings.
So go to Settings, edit the origin Remote and updated the Remote Account.
Unfortunately as at v3.3.8, SourceTree doesn't seem to save the account change. This appears to be a common issue (https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Sourcetree-questions/Sourcetree-is-showing-a-red-exclamation-mark-next-to-Remote/qaq-p/909571) so hopefully it will be fixed in a new version.

### Clearing an installed version of SourceTree
