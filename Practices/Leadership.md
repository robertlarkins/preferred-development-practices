Management that sparks new leaders.
How to transform somebody into a leader
- Need a leadership/management structure.
- Freedom and Power to make changes across the organisation
- Specialisation and focus

How can we scale leadership
1. Leadership isn't management
   - Managers keep the company running in a predictable fashion
   - Leadership is working with goals & vision. Management is working with objectives
   - Positional leadership doesn't scale - you donâ€™t have to be a manager to lead
   - To scale we must
   - Both ask ideas, and present problems and ask for solutions
   - Sponsor, reward, repeat
   - Participation
   - Golden Question - What would you do if you had another pair of hands
2. Anyone can be a leader
   - Don't needs books, conferences, courses, seminars, MBA
   - Leadership potential - how do you know whether a person can be a leader?
   - Ask what a person wants to do, is passionate about
   - Instead of traits, look for passion
   - Ask teammates what they think I'm good at, compare with what you think you're good at.
3. Create Leadership moments
   - Leaders take responsibility for what happends next
   - Create a culture that people feel safe to takes risks
   - Create a leadership culture
   - Nordstrom employee handbook
   - Mentor vs Sponsor
   - Find sponsors with opportunities for you

Leadership needs the folling to spark: _Passion, Permission and opportunity_

Modern leadership tips:
- Embrace change
- Increase your network
- Leaders make new leaders

Conflicts in leadership don't tend to happen
- Number of people stepping up is pretty low
- Passionate people group together
- You can both be a manager and a leader
- Management doesn't scale, leadership does
