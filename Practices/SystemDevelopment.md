# System Development

Build the right thing, the thing that matters.

Observability - watch and better use data across the board, especially from production (use live data).

What is normal in the system, what does it look like for the user? Ensure users have a good experience.

[Christine Yen - Observability and the development process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSO9YFi6Oqs)

Ask new questions to ship better software.

Notes from Raquel Velez talk - The engineering of craft
It helps to use analogies/metaphors for describing an engineering development process.

Product Spec
- Who is our customer
- What is their problem
- Propose a solution
- Success criteria
- It is about the _end_ user

Tech Spec
- Take a pattern that already exists and modify
or
- Create pattern from scratch

First Prototype
- Can be thrown away
- Quick
- Continuous iteration

TDD
- The tests should be perfect

Break and iterate

Make iterations small to better course correct.

More frequent commits
- What was done, why, when
- how do I go back

- Version Control
- Backups
- Code reviews
- Peer programming

Making the right trade-offs

Understand what tools are needed and how to use them (correctly). Often learnt from practice.

Think of coding from a different perspective, it is a craft.

Do something different, break and iterate.

Paying off technical debt

- maintainability
- performance & scalability
  - better use of cloud services
- developer experience - will they enjoy it and be more productive

The software built wasn't really the software needed (like having Trello but needing Jira).

- UX can differentiate a product - engage end users
- To build simple requires a lot of design and thought
- Don't want team members waiting for help
- Aim for better, not perfect - we don't have infinite time
- Have unit tests that describe what the user will be doing (behaviour tests), make them higher level.
- Efficiency vs. Effectiveness - How to approach development

_I don't know_ does not mean _no_

Engineering and design are creative practices. Uncertainty can make better produces, people and leaders.
Uncertainty is profoundly uncomfortable for people: reframe, get curious, work with the situation.
- Have a curious mindset
- Have people you trust and who trust you - listen
- Ask for, or accept help
