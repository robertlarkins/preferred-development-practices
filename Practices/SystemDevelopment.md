# System Development

Build the right thing, the thing that matters.

Observability - watch and better use data across the board, especially from production (use live data).

What is normal in the system, what does it look like for the user? Ensure users have a good experience.

Ask new questions to ship better software.

Notes from Raquel Velez talk - The engineering of craft
It helps to use analogies/metaphors for describing an engineering development process.

Product Spec
- Who is our customer
- What is their problem
- Propose a solution
- Success criteria
- It is about the _end_ user

Tech Spec
- Take a pattern that already exists and modify
or
- Create pattern from scratch

First Prototype
- Can be thrown away
- Quick
- Continuous iteration

TDD
- The tests should be perfect

Break and iterate
